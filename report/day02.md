# 📅 Day Report – Counter App (React)

## 📌 Project Title
Responsive Counter Application using React

---

## 🧾 Summary

Today, I built a **Counter Application** using **React Functional Components** and the **useState hook**.  
The application allows users to **increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** a numeric value.  

The UI was enhanced using **modern CSS**, including:
- Responsive layout
- Grid-based button alignment
- Mobile-friendly design
- Clean card-style interface

This project helped reinforce core React concepts such as **state management**, **event handling**, and **conditional UI updates**, along with **responsive UI design principles**.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

- Increment counter value
- Decrement counter value
- Reset counter to zero
- Fully responsive UI
- Grid-based button layout
- Smooth hover and click effects

## 🧠 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

1. Initialize a state variable `cnt` with initial value `0`.
2. Display the current value of `cnt` on the UI.
3. When the **Increment** button is clicked:
   - Increase `cnt` by `1`.
4. When the **Decrement** button is clicked:
   - Decrease `cnt` by `1`.
5. When the **Reset** button is clicked:
   - Set `cnt` back to `0`.
6. On every state change:
   - React automatically re-renders the UI with updated value.
